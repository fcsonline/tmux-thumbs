A lightning fast version of [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for copy pasting with vimium/vimperator like hints.

## Usage

Press ( <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> ) to highlight in you current tmux
visible pane all text that match specific patterns. Then press the highlighted
letter hint to yank the text in your tmux buffer.

### Matched patterns

- File paths
- File in diff
- Git SHAs
- IPFS CID's
- Colors in hex
- Numbers ( 4+ digits )
- Hex numbers
- Markdown urls
- IPv4, IPv6 addresses
- Docker images
- kubernetes resources
- UUIDs

These are the list of matched patterns that will be highlighted by default. If
you want to highlight a pattern that is not in this list you can add one or
more with `--regexp` parameter.

## Demo

[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/232775.png?ts=1)](https://asciinema.org/a/232775?autoplay=1)

## Prerequisites

`tmux-thumbs` is written in Rust. You will need `rustc` version 1.35.0 or higher. The
recommended way to install Rust is from the official [download page](https://rustup.rs/).

## Tmux integration

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/fcsonline/tmux-thumbs ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-thumbs
```

Compile it with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```
cd ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-thumbs
cargo build --release
```

Source it in your `.tmux.conf`:

```
run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-thumbs/tmux-thumbs.tmux
```

Reload TMUX conf by running:

```
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

## Using Tmux Plugin Manager

You can add this line to your list of [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g @plugin 'fcsonline/tmux-thumbs'

run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-thumbs/tmux-thumbs.tmux
```

To be able to install the plugin just hit <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>. You should now be able to use
the plugin!

### @thumbs-key

`default: space`

Choose which key is used to enter in thumbs mode.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-key F
```

If you want to customize the way how `tmux-thumbs` is triggered, you can always
bind whatever key to `thumbs-pick` command. For example:

```
bind-key \; thumbs-pick
```

### @thumbs-alphabet

`default: qwerty`

Choose which set of characters is used to build hints. Review all [available alphabets](#Alphabets)

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-alphabet dvorak-homerow
```

### @thumbs-reverse

`default: disabled`

Choose in which direction you want to assign hints. Useful to get shorter hints closer to the cursor.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-reverse enabled
```

### @thumbs-unique

`default: disabled`

Choose if you want to assign the same hint for the same matched strings.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-unique enabled
```

### @thumbs-position

`default: left`

Choose where do you want to show the hint in the matched string. Options (left, right, off_left, off_right).

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-position right
```

### @thumbs-regexp-N

Add extra patterns to match. This parameter can have multiple instances.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-regexp-1 '[a-z]+@[a-z]+.com' # Match emails
set -g @thumbs-regexp-2 '[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:' # Match MAC addresses
set -g @thumbs-regexp-3 'Vlan\d+' # match Vlan interface on network devices
set -g @thumbs-regexp-4 "Vlan\\d+" # alternative method of defining regexp
set -g @thumbs-regexp-5 Vlan\\d+ # alternative method of defining regexp
```

### @thumbs-command

`default: 'tmux set-buffer -- {} && tmux display-message \"Copied {}\"'`

Choose which command execute when you press a hint. `tmux-thumbs` will replace `{}` with the picked hint.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-command 'echo -n {} | pbcopy'
```

### @thumbs-upcase-command

`default: 'tmux set-buffer -- {} && tmux paste-buffer && tmux display-message \"Copied {}\"'`

Choose which command execute when you press a upcase hint. `tmux-thumbs` will replace `{}` with the picked hint.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-upcase-command 'echo -n {} | pbcopy'
```

### @thumbs-multi-command

`default: 'tmux set-buffer -- {} && tmux paste-buffer && tmux send-keys ' ' && tmux display-message \"Copied multiple items!\"'`

Choose which command execute when you select multiple items. `tmux-thumbs` will replace `{}` with the picked hint for each one.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-multi-command 'echo -n {}'
```

### @thumbs-bg-color

`default: black`

Sets the background color for matches

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-bg-color blue
```

### @thumbs-fg-color

`default: green`

Sets the foreground color for matches

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-fg-color green
```

### @thumbs-hint-bg-color

`default: black`

Sets the background color for hints

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-hint-bg-color blue
```

### @thumbs-hint-fg-color

`default: yellow`

Sets the foreground color for hints

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-hint-fg-color green
```

### @thumbs-select-fg-color

`default: blue`

Sets the foreground color for selection

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-select-fg-color red
```

### @thumbs-select-bg-color

`default: black`

Sets the background color for selection

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-select-bg-color red
```

### @thumbs-multi-fg-color

`default: yellow`

Sets the foreground color for multi selected item

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-multi-fg-color green
```

### @thumbs-multi-bg-color

`default: black`

Sets the background color for multi selected item

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-multi-bg-color red
```

### @thumbs-contrast

`default: 0`

Displays hint character in square brackets for extra visibility.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-contrast 1
```

### @thumbs-osc52

`default: 0`

If this is set to `1`, `tmux-thumbs` will print a OSC52 copy escape sequence when you select a match, in addition to running the pick command. This sequence, in terminals that support it (e.g. iTerm), allows the content to be copied into the system clipboard in addition to the tmux copy buffer.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-osc52 1
```

#### Colors

## Extra features

- **Arrow navigation:** You can use the arrows to move around between all matched items.
- **Auto paste:** If your last typed hint character is uppercase, you are going to pick and paste the desired hint.

### Multi selection

If you want to enable the capability to choose multiple matches, you have to
press <kbd>Space</kbd>. Then, choose the matches with highlighted hints or
<kbd>Enter</kbd> (moving with cursors) and then <kbd>Space</kbd> again to
output all of them.

If you run standalone `thumbs` with multi selection mode (-m) you will be able to choose multiple hints pressing the desired letter and <kbd>Space</kbd> to finalize the selection.

If you can check hat `tmux-thumbs` is or is not compatible with some specific version of `tmux`, let me know.

## Standalone `thumbs`

This project started as a `tmux` plugin but after reviewing it with some
friends we decided to explore all the possibilities of decoupling thumbs from
`tmux`. You can install it with a simple command:

```
cargo install thumbs
```

And those are all available options:

```
thumbs 0.7.0
A lightning fast version copy/pasting like vimium/vimperator

    -x, --regexp <regexp>...                           Use this regexp as extra pattern to match
        --select-bg-color <select_background_color>    Sets the background color for selection [default: black]
        --select-fg-color <select_foreground_color>    Sets the foreground color for selection [default: blue]
        --multi-bg-color <multi_background_color>      Sets the background color for a multi selected item [default: black]
        --multi-fg-color <multi_foreground_color>      Sets the foreground color for a multi selected item [default: cyan]
    -t, --target <target>                              Stores the hint in the specified path
```


If you want to enjoy terminal hints, you can do things like this without `tmux`:

```
> alias pick='thumbs -u -r | xsel --clipboard -i'
> git log | pick
```

Or multi selection:

```
> git log | thumbs -m
1df9fa69c8831ac042c6466af81e65402ee2a007
4897dc4ecbd2ac90b17de95e00e9e75bb540e37f
```

Standalone `thumbs` has some similarities to [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

## Background

As I said, this project is based in [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers). Morantron did an extraordinary job, building all necessary pieces in Bash to achieve the text picker behaviour. He only deserves my gratitude for all the time I have been using [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers).

During a [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org/) conf, we had the idea to rewrite it to another language. He had these thoughts many times ago but it was hard to start from scratch. So, we decided to start playing with Node.js and [react-blessed](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed), but we detected some unacceptable latency when the program booted. We didn't investigate much about this latency.

During those days another alternative appeared, called [tmux-picker](https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/tmux-picker), implemented in python and reusing many parts from [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers). It was nice, because it was fast and added original terminal color support.

I was curious to know if this was possible to be written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and soon I realized that was something doable. The ability to implement tests for all critic parts of the application give you a great confidence about it. On the other hand, Rust has an awesome community that lets you achieve this kind of project in a short period of time.

## Roadmap

- [X] Support multi selection
- [X] Decouple `tmux-thumbs` from `tmux`
- [ ] Code [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) plugin, now that `thumbs` can run standalone

## Troubleshooting

Tmux-thumbs must work lighting fast. If you are facing a slow performance capturing the screen hints try to configure Tmux with these settings:

```
set -g visual-activity off
set -g visual-bell off
set -g visual-silence on
```

## Contribute

This project started as a side project to learn Rust, so I'm sure that is full
of mistakes and areas to be improve. If you think you can tweak the code to
make it better, I'll really appreciate a pull request. ;)
