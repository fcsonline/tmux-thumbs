# tmux-thumbs

![](https://travis-ci.com/fcsonline/tmux-thumbs.svg?branch=master)

A lightning fast version of [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for copy pasting with vimium/vimperator like hints.

## Usage

Press ( <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> ) to highlist in you current tmux
visible pane all text that match specific pattern. Then press the highlighted
letter hint to yank the text in your tmux buffer.

### Matched patterns

- File paths
- File in diff
- Git SHAs
- IPFS CID's
- Colors in hex
- Numbers ( 4+ digits )
- Hex numbers
- Markdown urls
- IP4 addresses
- kubernetes resources
- UUIDs

These are the list of mattched patterns that will be highlighted by default. If
you want to highlight a pattern that is not in this list you can add one or
more with `--regexp` parameter.

cargo build --release
```

Source it in your `.tmux.conf`:

```
run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-thumbs/tmux-thumbs.tmux
```

Reload TMUX conf by running:

```
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

### @thumbs-key

`default: space`

Choose which key is used to enter in thumbs mode.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-key F
```

### @thumbs-alphabet

`default: qwerty`

Choose which set of characters is used to build hints. Review all [available alphabets](#Alphabets)

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-alphabet dvorak-homerow
```

### @thumbs-reverse

`default: disabled`

Choose in which direction you want to assign hints. Useful to get shorter hints closer to the cursor.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-reverse
```

### @thumbs-unique

`default: disabled`

Choose if you want to assign the same hint for the same matched strings.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-unique
```

### @thumbs-position

`default: left`

Choose where do you want to show the hint in the matched string. Options (left, right).

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-position right
```

### @thumbs-regexp-N

Add extra patterns to match. This paramenter can have multiple instances.

For example:

```
set @thumbs-regexp-1 '[a-z]+@[a-z]+.com' # Match emails
set @thumbs-regexp-2 '[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:[a-f0-9]{2}:' # Match MAC addresses
```

### @thumbs-command

`default: 'tmux set-buffer {}'`

Choose which command execute when you press a hint. `tmux-thumbs` will replace `{}` with the picked hint.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-command 'echo {} | pbcopy'
```

### @thumbs-upcase-command

`default: 'tmux set-buffer {} && tmux paste-buffer'`

Choose which command execute when you press a upcase hint. `tmux-thumbs` will replace `{}` with the picked hint.

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-upcase-command 'echo {} | pbcopy'
```

### @thumbs-bg-color

`default: black`

Sets the background color for matches

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-bg-color blue
```

### @thumbs-fg-color

`default: green`

Sets the foregroud color for matches

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-fg-color green
```

### @thumbs-hint-bg-color

`default: black`

Sets the background color for hints

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-hint-bg-color blue
```

### @thumbs-hint-fg-color

`default: yellow`

Sets the foregroud color for hints

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-hint-fg-color green
```

### @thumbs-select-fg-color

`default: blue`

Sets the foregroud color for selection

For example:

```
set -g @thumbs-select-fg-color red
```

### @thumbs-contrast

`default: 0`

## Background

As I said, this project is based in [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers). Morantron did an extraordinary job, building all necessary pieces in Bash to achieve the text picker behaviour. He only deserves my gratitude for all the time I have been using [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers).

During a [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org/) conf, we had the idea to rewrite it to another language. He had these thoughts many times ago but it was hard to start from scratch. So, we decided to start playing with Node.js and [react-blessed](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed), but we detected some unacceptable latency when the program booted. We didn't investigate much about this latency.

During those days another alternative appeared, called [tmux-picker](https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/tmux-picker), implemented in python and reusing many parts from [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers). It was nice, because it was fast and added original terminal color support.

I was curious to know if this was possible to be written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and soon I realized that was something doable. The ability to implement tests for all critic parts of the application give you a great confidence about it. On the other hand, Rust has an awesome community that lets you achieve this kind of project in a short period of time.

## Contribute

This project started as a side project to learn Rust, so I'm sure that is full
of mistakes and areas to be improve. If you think you can tweak the code to
make it better, I'll really appreaciate a pull request. ;)
